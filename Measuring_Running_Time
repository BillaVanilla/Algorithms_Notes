// Basic operation - The operation contributing the most to total running time.
// Sorting algorithms - Comparing elements (also known as keys) of a list/array being sorted and he basic operation is a key comparison.
// Time efficientcy formula: T(n) = c(op) C(n), T(n) > running time, c(op) > execution time, C(n) > # of times a basic operation is executed, formula = input size.
// Example problem: If the # of times a basic operations is: C(n) = (1/2)n*(n-1). What is the algorithm run time if the input is doubled? 
// Answer: (1/2) n^2 - (1/2)n = (1/2)n^2 = C(n), C(2n) = (1/2) 2n^2, (C(2n))/C(n) = 4. There the running time will be 4 times the amount.

// Problem: Find greatest common divisor of two nonnegative, non zero integers (gcd(m,n)). 

// Euclid Algorithm:  Repeated application of equality until the second number becomes 0.
// Step 1: If n = 0, return m and stop; otherwise go to Step 2
// Step 2 Divide m by n and assign the value of the remainder to remainder
// Step 3 Assign the value of n to m and remainder to n. Go to Step 1.
// Java Example: 
int m = 60;
int n = 24;
int remainder;
while (n != 0) {
remainder = m%n;
m = n;
n = remainder;
}
System.out.println("Greatest Common Divisor is :" + m);

// Consecutive integer checking algorithm:  Works by finding the greatest common divisor of m and n as the largest integer that divides both numbers evenly.
// Step 1 Assign the value of min{m,n} to t
// Step 2 Divide m by t. If the remainder is 0, go to Step 3; otherwise, go to Step 4
// Step 3 Divide n by t. If the remainder is 0, return t and stop; otherwise, go to Step 4
// Step 4 Decrease t by 1 and go to Step 2

// Middle school Procedure:
// Step 1 Find the prime factorization of m
// Step 2 Find the prime factorization of n
// Step 3 Find all the common prime factors
// Step 4 Compute the product of all the common prime factors and return it as gcd(m,n)

// Sieve of Eratosthenes: 
// Step 1: The algorithm starts by initializing a list of prime candidates with consecutive integers from 2 to n.
// Step 2: Then, on its first iteration, the algorithm eliminates from the list all multiples of 2, i.e., 4, 6, and so on.
// Step 3: Then it moves to the next item on the list, which is 3, and eliminates its multiples.
// Step 4: No pass for number 4 is needed: since 4 itself and all its multiples are also multiples of 2, they were already eliminated on a previous pass.
// Step 5: The remaining number on the list, which is used on the third pass, is 5.
// This process should leave us with the remaining list of prime numbers needed.
